# DataStructBackend

Data Structure made easy, inspired by the book of Robert Lafore "data structures and algorithms in java".
Using C# as backend, and angular as frontend, I try to illustrate algorithms like the author did.

## In progress

* Binary search (applicable to an ordered array)
* Linear search
* Bubble sort: consists of swapping values in an array until entire array is ordered
* Stack: you are only allowed to access the last inserted item. If you remove this item, you can access the next to last item inserted.

### Ordered array:

 Pros: Fast search because one can use binary search. Ordered array is useful in an application where search are frequent.
 Cons: insertion (write) takes longer because all data items with higher key value must be moved up to make room.

## RoadMap:

* Binary Search
* Sorting Algorithms (bubble, selection, insertion)
* Stacks and queues
* Linked lists
* Recursion
* MergeSort
* Tree structures
